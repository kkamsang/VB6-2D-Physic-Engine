   Contibutors: yet none.	

Never found a VB6 implementation of a simple 2D physic engine. So I come to a VB6 version starting from 
Randy Gaul 2D impulse engine (and Philip Diffenderfer java port).

I also added other things such as
+Joints  (Not so perfect, look for someone to suggest better implementation)
+Collision Groups (To make some objects not collide with every objects)
+collsions callback events
+Polygon Chamfer

This is the old thread of this project , Since it works quite well I decided to put it in the CodeBank session.
Now instead of a number of modules I compacted them to 1 class and 1 module.

Suggestions and improvements are wellcome !


(Later I'll put the code on GitHub)
